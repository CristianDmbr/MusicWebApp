        <h2>Congradulations Lyrics :</h2>
        <pre>
            My momma called, seen you on TV, son
            Said things done changed ever since we was on
            I dreamed it all ever since I was young
            
            They said I wouldn't be nothing
            Now they always say congratulations
            
            Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
            They ain't never had the dedication
            People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it
            
            Yeah, we made it
            They was never friendly, yeah
            Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
            And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
            
            But I know I had to have it, yeah
            For the money, I'm determined, yeah
            I be itching like a fanatic, yeah
            
            I'm surrounded, plenty of friends, yeah
            But they didn't know me last year, yeah
            Everyone wanna act like they important
            (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
            
            But all that mean nothing when I saw my dog
            (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
            Everyone counting on me, drop the ball
            
            (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
            Everything costing like I'm at the bottom, yeah, yeah
            If you love winning, put your lighters to the sky
            
            How could I make sense when I got millions on my mind?
            Coming with that nonsense, I just put it to the side
            Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes
            My momma called, seen you on TV, son
            
            Said things done changed ever since we was on
            I dreamed it all ever since I was young
            They said I wouldn't be nothing
            Now they always say congratulations
            
            Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
            They ain't never had the dedication
            People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
            
            Yeah, we made it
            I was patient, yeah, oh
            I was patient, aye, oh
            Now I can scream that we made it
            
            Now everyone, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulations
            Young fellow, young fellow, graduation
            I pick up the rock and I ball, baby
            I'm looking for someone to call, baby
            
            But right now, I got a situation
            Nothing but old Ben-Ben Franklins
            Big rings, champagne
            My life is like a ball game
            
            But instead, I'm in the studio
            Pot so big, call it Super Bowl
            Super Bowl, call the friends, get in the Rolls
            Top-floor lifestyle, Huncho and Post
            
            Malone, I got a play on my phone, aye
            You know what I'm on, aye
            Huncho Houdini is gone, aye
            My momma called, seen you on TV, son
            Said things done changed ever since we was on
            
            I dreamed it all ever since I was young
            They said I wouldn't be nothing
            Now they always say congratulations
            Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
            They ain't never had the dedication
            
            People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
            Yeah, we made it
