            The club isn't the best place to find a lover
            So the bar is where I go
            Me and my friends at the table doing shots
            Drinking fast and then we talk slow
            Come over and start up a conversation with just me
            And trust me I'll give it a chance now
            Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
            And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
            Girl, you know I want your love
            Your love was handmade for somebody like me
            Come on now, follow my lead
            I may be crazy, don't mind me
            Say, boy, let's not talk too much
            Grab on my waist and put that body on me
            Come on now, follow my lead
            Come, come on now, follow my lead
            I'm in love with the shape of you
            We push and pull like a magnet do
            Although my heart is falling too
            I'm in love with your body
            And last night you were in my room
            And now my bedsheets smell like you
            Every day discovering something brand new
            I'm in love with your body
            (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
            I'm in love with your body
            (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
            I'm in love with your body
            (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
            I'm in love with your body
            Every day discovering something brand new
            I'm in love with the shape of you
            One week in we let the story begin
            We're going out on our first date
            You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
            Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
            We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
            And how your family is doing okay
            And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
            Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
            Girl, you know I want your love
            Your love was handmade for somebody like me
            Come on now, follow my lead
            I may be crazy, don't mind me
            Say, boy, let's not talk too much
            Grab on my waist and put that body on me
            Come on now, follow my lead
            Come, come on now, follow my lead
            I'm in love with the shape of you
            We push and pull like a magnet do
            Although my heart is falling too
            I'm in love with your body
            And last night you were in my room
            And now my bedsheets smell like you
            Every day discovering something brand new
            I'm in love with your body
            (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
            I'm in love with your body
            (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
            I'm in love with your body
            (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
            I'm in love with your body
            Every day discovering something brand new
            I'm in love with the shape of you
            Come on, be my baby, come on
            Come on, be my baby, come on
            Come on, be my baby, come on
            Come on, be my baby, come on
            Come on, be my baby, come on
            Come on, be my baby, come on
            Come on, be my baby, come on
            Come on, be my baby, come on
            I'm in love with the shape of you
            We push and pull like a magnet do
            Although my heart is falling too
            I'm in love with your body
            And last night you were in my room
            And now my bedsheets smell like you
            Every day discovering something brand new
            I'm in love with your body
            Come on, be my baby, come on
            Come on (I'm in love with your body), be my baby, come on
            Come on, be my baby, come on
            Come on (I'm in love with your body), be my baby, come on
            Come on, be my baby, come on
            Come on (I'm in love with your body), be my baby, come on
            Every day discovering something brand new
            I'm in love with the shape of you
