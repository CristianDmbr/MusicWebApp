    <pre>
        na-na, yeah
        I saw you dancing in a crowded room, uh
        You look so happy when I'm not with you
        
        But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
        A single teardrop falling from your eye
        I don't know why I run away
        I make you cry when I run away
        You could've asked me why I broke your heart
        
        You could've told me that you fell apart
        But you walked past me like I wasn't there
        And just pretended like you didn't care
        I don't know why I run away
        
        I make you cry when I run away
        Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
        Save your tears for another
        Save your tears for another day
        
        Save your tears for another day (so)
        I made you think that I would always stay (uh)
        I said some things that I should never say
        
        Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
        And now you won't love me for a second time
        I don't know why I run away (uh), oh, girl
        
        Said, I make you cry when I run away
        Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
        Save your tears for another (uh)
        I realize that I'm much too late
        
        And you deserve someone better
        Save your tears for another day (oh, yeah)
        Save your tears for another day (yeah)
        I don't know why I run away
        
        I'll make you cry when I run away
        Save your tears for another day
        Ooh, girl, I said (ah)
        
        Save your tears for another day (ah)
        Save your tears for another day (ah)
        Save your tears for another day (ah)
